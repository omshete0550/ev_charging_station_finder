## About The Project

Development of an innovative Electric Vehicle Charging Station Finder app, empowering users to seamlessly locate nearby charging stations for their electric vehicles. The app offers a user-friendly interface that displays a comprehensive map of charging stations, enabling users to effortlessly identify and navigate to the nearest available options. Users can mark preferred stations as favorites for quick access and conveniently log in using their Google accounts. Furthermore, the app allows users to personalize their experience by updating their profiles, ensuring a tailored and user-centric approach to sustainable transportation. This project underscores my skills in mobile app development, geolocation services, user authentication, and delivering solutions that contribute to the growing ecosystem of electric vehicle infrastructure.
